# SHREC'19 track: Matching Humans with Different Connectivity

![Alt text](/all.png?raw=true "Teaser")

This page contains MATLAB code to evaluate matchings inside our SHREC'19 track.

This repository contains:
- all shapes in .mat format
- groundtruth matches
- evaluation code used to generate curves plots of our paper

We also provide an example (the functional map matchings) to test that the code runs correctly.

The two provided scripts have to be executed in order:

```
1_compute_curves.m
2_show_curves.m
```
